📁 Project: React Counter App

📌 Overview:
A simple counter application built using React. The goal is to practice using the `useState` hook and handling events in a React functional component.

This app will display a number on the screen and provide three buttons:
- Increment the count
- Decrement the count
- Reset the count to zero

🎯 Objective:
- Learn how to use the `useState` hook to manage component state.
- Understand how React re-renders components on state changes.
- Practice JSX and basic React event handling.

📚 Concepts Used:
- React Functional Components
- useState Hook
- Event Handling
- JSX
- Conditional Rendering (Optional Styling)

🧱 Features:
1. Display the current count value on screen.
2. "Increment" button increases the count by 1.
3. "Decrement" button decreases the count by 1.
4. "Reset" button sets the count back to 0.
5. (Optional) Prevent the counter from going below 0.
6. (Optional) Display message like "Negative values not allowed" or style the count in red if it's negative.
